	<h1>Adding pages and sections to your site</h1>
	<p>Pages and sections allow you to organize your Segue site.  Sections allow you to contain a set of pages so that they are visible only when that section is selected (much like a folder).  Pages allow you to contain a set of content blocks.  To create a page or section, do the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the "+ Page..." link on your site.</li>
		<li>Chose the type of page or navigation you want to add to your site.</li>
		<li>Type a title for your new page or section and click the submit button.</li>
	</ol>


	<h2>Page</h2>
	<p>Chose "Page" if you want another place on your site to put content. When you create a new page, you will see a link to "[[Adding Content|+ Content]]" when you view that page.</p>
	
	<h2>Page with Sidebar</h2>
	<p>Chose "Page with Sidebar" if you want to have a sidebar on your page.  A sidebar is simply another column on your page where you can put additional content.  For example a page may consist of many blog posts in its main column and then have a blogroll (i.e. links to other blogs) in its sidebar.</p>
	
	<h2>Section</h2>
	<p>Chose "Section" if you want to create a set of pages that are related and viewable only when that section is selected (much like files in a folder).  When you create a new section, the first page in that section will be displayed by default.</p>

	<h2>Section with Sidebar</h2>
	<p>Chose "Section with Sidebar" if you want to have a sidebar in your section.  A sidebar is simply another column in your section where you can put additional content.  This sidebar content will appear on every page in that section.  For example, an "Assignment" section of a site might contain pages for each assignment.  The sidebar might contain information common to all assignments such as assignment submission guidelines. </p>
	
	<h2>Content Blocks</h2>
	<p>The "+ Page..." option list also includes all the same options that are available when you click on the link to "[[Adding Content|+ Content]]."</p>
