	<h1>About Site Aliases</h1>
	<p>Placeholders (visable in your [[Portal]]) are locations where you can create sites. Sometimes however, rather than creating a new site you wish to continue directing users to an existing site from a second placeholder name. Aliases display in the portal similarly to normal sites.</p>
	
	<h1>Creating an Alias</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to your [[Portal]] and browse to the placeholder that you wish to make an alias. This placeholder must be empty and not already have a site created.</li>
		<li>Click on the <strong>make alias</strong> link.</li>
		<li>Type the name of the placeholder you wish to be the target of the alias, e.g. <code>chem0101b-f08</code> or <code>jdoe-research</code>.</li>
		<li>Click the <strong>Make Alias »</strong> button.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h1>Examples</h1>
	<h2>Usage Example 1 - Multiple Course Sections</h2>
	<p>For example, lets say that a single course has several sections all of whom should be directed to one shared site.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>span0101a-f08</code></li>
		<li><code>span0101b-f08</code></li>
		<li><code>span0101c-f08</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>A single site can be made in the placeholder for one of the sections:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>span0101a-f08</code> - site created, <em>Español 101</em></li>
		<li><code>span0101b-f08</code></li>
		<li><code>span0101c-f08</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>All other sections can be made aliases of the placeholder where the site was created; in this way students registered for other sections will see the site listed in their portal.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>span0101a-f08</code> - site created, <em>Español 101</em></li>
		<li><code>span0101b-f08</code> - alias of <code>span0101a-f08</code></li>
		<li><code>span0101c-f08</code> - alias of <code>span0101a-f08</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>As usual, students registered for section <code>a</code> will see the site listed in the <em>Current Classes</em> section of their [[Portal]]. As well, students registered for sections <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> will now also see the site listed under their <em>Current Classes</em>.</p>
	
	<h2>Usage Example 2 - Moving a Site</h2>
	<p>If a site is moved to a new placeholder an alias can be made from the old placeholder to the new one. This will allow users that have links or bookmarks to the old location of the site to be automatically redirected to the new location.</p>
