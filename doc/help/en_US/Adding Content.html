	<h1>Adding content to your site</h1>
	<p>There are many different kinds of content you can add to your Segue site including text, images, files and RSS feeds.  Here are the steps for adding new content to your site:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the "+ Content" link in the content container where you want to put your new content.</li>
		<li>Chose the type of content you want to add to your site.</li>
		<li>Type a title for your new content and click the submit button.</li>
		<li>Locate your new content block and click on the link to "edit" within it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><i>Note: A title is required for all content.  However you can choose to hide the title if its display is not appropriate</i></p>

	<h2>Text &amp; Images</h2>
	<p>Chose this content type when you want to add text and images to your site.  The "Text &amp; Images" content block has an editor that allows you to format your text and insert images.  As well you can use [[wiki-linking]] to create links to other parts of your site and include [[text-templates]] that allow you to insert predefined scripts or objects.</p>
	
	<h2>Files</h2>
	<p>Chose this content type when you want to add files to your site that visitors can download. Files can include word processing files (e.g. Microsoft Word documents), spreadsheets (e.g. Microsoft Excel files), PDFs or any other file type.</p>
	<p><i>Note: Your site visitors may need to have the appropriate application installed on their computer to view your files.</i></p>
	
	<h2>RSS Feed Display</h2>
	<p>Chose this content type when you want to include an RSS feed from another site.  You can also use this content type to display RSS feeds from another part of the same site.  For example, you could include the RSS feed for all discussion posts throughout your site on the main page of your site to show site visitors recent discussions.</p>

	<h2>RSS Links</h2>
	<p>Chose this content type if you want to display your site's content and discussion RSS links.  Most templates include a content block of this type in the site's header.</p>
	
	<h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
	<p>Chose this content type if you want to display information about the current location within your site.  Most templates include a content block of this type in the site's header.</p>
