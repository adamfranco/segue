	<h1>Using the Rich-Text Editor</h1>
	<p>Segue includes the <a href='http://www.fckeditor.net/' target='new_window'>FCKeditor</a>, a popular open-source web-based text editing tool.  This tool allows you to format your text as well as include tables, links and images.</p>

	<h2>Formatting Text</h2>
	<p>Segue's rich-text editor has formatting options similar to word processing applications such as Microsoft Word including options for aligning text left, right or center, making words bold or underlining or rendering in italics.  As well there are options for creating bulleted and numbered lists.  Moving your mouse over the toolbar icons will display their function</p>
	
	<h2>Copying and Pasting Text from Word</h2>
	<p>You can copy text from a Word document and paste it into the editor.  We strongly recommend that you use the editor's "Paste from Word" tool print (i.e. click on this tool's icon in the editor and paste into its field first, and then click its OK button). Keep in mind that not all the formatting that you can do in Microsoft Word can be translated into a format for the web.</p>	
	
	<h2>Inserting Images</h2>
	<p>Click on the editor's image tool to add images to the content block.  Then do the following:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Click on the Browse Server button to open your site's Media Library.</li>  
	<li>Click on the Browse button to browse your desktop for the image you want to upload.</li>
	<li>Chose that image, click the Upload button to add it to your Media Library.</li>
	<li>Click the Use button to use that image in the content block.</li>  
	</ol>
	
	<p>The Image Properties window allows you to define where this image aligns in relation to the text around it, as well as define hspace and vspace which determines how closely the text wraps to your image.</p>
	
	<h2>Inserting Links</h2>
	<p>To add links to other sites in your text do the following:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Select the text you want to make into a link.</li>
	<li>Click on the editor's link tool.</li>
	<li>Type in the url that you want to link to.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><i>The editor's link tool has options for specifying the target of your link.  If you want your link to open in a new window, set your target to "New Window."</i></p>
