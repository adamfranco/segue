		<h1>About Segue</h1>
		<p>Segue is a curricular content management system designed for teaching, learning and research.  It is essentially a synthesis of wikis, blogs and traditional content management systems.  Segue borrows from the blogosphere the notion of multiple entries or posts on a page, each with their own URL and attached comments.  Segue then provides a version history of each post and allows users to link between posts using "wiki" markup.  When a "wiki link" is created to content that does not exist, a "create node" link is displayed that allows users to add that content.  Finally, like many content management systems, Segue allows users to organize their sites hierarchically and control access by specifying who can discuss, edit or delete any existing content as well as who can add new content.</p>

		<p>Segue is designed for collaboration, its very granular access control enables Segue to be used to manage individual and group blogs, wikis, courses, e-portfolios, peer review, portals, research collaboration and personal repositories.  Central to Segue is the notion of "versioned microcontent", of many individual content blocks on a page, each with their own URL, RSS feed and version history.  These content blocks can be sorted in a various ways including reverse chronological or completely custom ordering.  As well, these content blocks can be organized hierarchically (i.e. top-down) through sets of navigation links and associatively (i.e. bottom-up) by means of tags and tag aggregation.</p>
		
		<p><strong> Segue v2</strong><br/>
		A beta version of <a href="https://segue2.middlebury.edu/view/html/node/472836">Segue v2</a> is now available for download.  Segue v2 will eventually include all the features of <a href="https://segue2.middlebury.edu/view/html/node/469007">Segue 1x</a>, but will implement this functionality so that it is more flexible, extensible and scalable.  The Segue v2 codebase is fully object-oriented for more robust, manageable code and is built using the <a href="http://harmoni.sourceforge.net/wiki/" target="_blank">Harmoni</a> application framework which includes implementations of the <a href="http://www.okiproject.org/" target="_blank">Open Knowledge Initiative</a> (O.K.I.) open service interface definitions (OSID).  This means that it is a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and can expose much of its functionality as services based on open standards.  This should enable it to interoperate with other curricular systems such as <a href="http://sakaiproject.org/" target="_blank">Sakai</a> and <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> that are also planning to use these same standards in future releases.</p>

		<p>Segue v2 also has an innovative content rendering engine, that allows users to control the <a href="https://segue2.middlebury.edu/view/html/node/473660">layout</a> and flow of content on their site.  For a sample of some of the layouts possible in Segue v2, see: <a href="https://segue2.middlebury.edu/ui1/view/site/achapin-templates01">Segue v2 Template Development</a></p>
