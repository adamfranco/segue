	<h1>About the Portal</h1>
	<p>The Portal is the place in Segue where you can find listings of sites that you may be interested in using.</p>
	
	<p>Sites are sorted into a number of folders to make them easier to find. You can also search for sites using the search field in the folder-list.</p>
	
	<h1>What are placeholders?</h1>
	<p>"Placeholders" are locations where sites may be created. They have a unique name that identifies them and any site created in them. Some placeholders are created automatically (such as those for [[Portal#Course|courses]]) while others may be created by individuals ([[Portal#Personal|personal]]) or by administrators.</p>
	
	<p>If you are one of the owners of a placeholder, you may create a site in that placeholder. If the placeholder has multiple owners (such as for a course co-taught by several instructors) you will be prompted when creating a site as to whether you would like to make all placeholder-owners administrators of the new site. If you do not make them administrators of the new site, they will have no special access to the site above what you assign to them.</p>
	
	<h1>Types of placeholders and sites</h1>
	<h2>Personal</h2>
	<p>Authorized users can create as many personal sites as they would like. All personal sites are automatically prepended by your username followed by a dash.</p>
	
	<p>To create a personal site, use the following steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the 'Personal' folder in the 'Portal'</li>
		<li>In the top-center, there is a form to create a new placeholder. Enter a name for your placeholder and hit the 'Create' button.</li>
		<li>You should now see your placeholder listed.</li>
		<li>Click the "Create Site" link next to your new placeholder.</li>
		<li>Go through the wizard steps and click save.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Course</h2>
	<p>Course placeholders are automatically created for each course section based on listings in the course information system. Members of the course section (either students or instructors) will see the course-section listed. Only instructors are able to create a site for the course section</p>
	
	<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Currently only students registered for the section a site is created for will see that site listed in their portal. For instance: <br/><br/>If an instructor is teaching chem101a and chem101b and creates a site only for chem101a, then only students in chem101a will see the site in their portal. Students in both sections can be given authorization to view and work with the site. Students in section 'b' will just need to be emailed a link to the site to allow them to find it.</p>
	
	<p>To create a course site you must be listed as an instructor for the course:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the 'Upcomming Classes' or 'Current Classes' folder in the Portal.</li>
		<li>You should see placeholders listed for each class you are teaching.</li>
		<li>Click the "Create Site" link next to the course placeholder you wish to create a site for.</li>
		<li>Go through the wizard steps and click save.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Other</h2>
	
	<p>'Other' placeholders must be created by administrators. These placeholders have no restrictions on naming and are often used for things such as departmental sites. Contact your Segue administrator to create a placeholder that is not restricted to your username or a course.</p>
