			Also included is a 'search' template that can insert a customized search
			field into a text-block.
			Example of usage: {{search}}
			Example of usage: {{search|base_url=http://youtube.com/results|search_param_name=search_query}}

			Roles: Fixed Roles issue with 'invalid default state'.

			It appears that since the transition to the new AuthZ2 implementation,
			the roles system has not been working correctly when setting complex
			authorization. This issue stems from the 'new' property of 
			view authorizations cascading up as well as down. This cascading up
			was confusing the roles system. When there was no site-wide view 
			authorization the roles system thought that there was due to a view 
			authorization cascading up from a story or page.
			
			This has now been sorted out and the roles system only looks at implicit
			authorizations that cascade down when determining what role to display
			for a user.

			Roles: With 'Editor' role set for 'everyone' log-in is required to edit.

			To accomplish this, the role-system now merges authorizations for the
			'edu.middlebury.agents.everyone' group and the 
			'edu.middlebury.agents.users' group when viewing or setting roles for 
			'Everyone'.
			
			The 'edu.middlebury.agents.everyone' group (which includes the anonymous
			user) is only ever given the 'reader' role (view authorization) and the
			view_comments authorization (part of the 'commenter' role) while the
			'edu.middlebury.agents.users' group	(which includes all authenticated 
			users, even visitors) is given the additional authorizations.
			
			As far as the UI is concerned site admins are just setting roles for
			'Everyone', but now anonymous users aren't being given grants to make
			changes. This should prevent spam and make modifications at least
			nominally traceable.

			This release fixes a number of minor bugs that were affecting some

			As of this release Segue requires that PHP be compiled with the
