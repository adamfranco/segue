	<version number="2.0-beta-27" date="2008-07-17">
		<releaseNotes>
			This release adds support for embedded Flash videos, text-templates,
			and fixes several bugs.
			
			Text-templates are a new extension system that use the same markup as
			MediaWiki's templates to enable output of custom HTML blocks customized
			with a set of named parameters. 
			
			For example, a new 'video' template inserts embed code for videos from 
			a variety of providers defined in a white-list (to prevent XSS attacks). 
			Example of usage: {{video|service=youtube|id=s13dLaTIHSg|width=425|height=344}}
			This video template will also search through the HTML source in a 
			text-block and replace any embed or	object elements with appropriate template markup.
			
			Also included is a 'search' template that can insert a customized search
			field into a text-block.
			Example of usage: {{search}}
			Example of usage: {{search|base_url=http://youtube.com/results|search_param_name=search_query}}
			
			See the change-log for additional details on fixes.
			
			Segue 2.0-beta-27 uses Harmoni 1.4.3 and Polyphony 1.2.10.
			
			---------------------
			
			Upgrades:
			
			As of this beta 25, Segue requires PHP to be compiled with XSL support.
			On unix systems this can be added by configuring PHP using the --with-xsl
			option. See the following for installation instructions:
			http://www.php.net/manual/en/xsl.installation.php
			
			Upgrades from versions prior to beta 26 require running the RSS Feed
			updaters located under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates.

		<releaseNotes>
			This release fixes a few bugs that were not fixed in beta 26.
			
			---------------------
			
			From Beta 26:
			
			As of this beta 25, Segue requires PHP to be compiled with XSL support.
			On unix systems this can be added by configuring PHP using the --with-xsl
			option. See the following for installation instructions:

			Upgrades from versions prior to beta 26 require running the RSS Feed
			updaters located under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates.
			
			-----------------------
			
			Segue 2.0-beta-26.1 uses Harmoni 1.4.2 and Polyphony 1.2.8.
		</releaseNotes>
		<fix author='adam' date='2008-07-14' ref='2017290' reftype='bug' reporter='laurel_taylor'>
			Themes: Added missing method getModificationDate() that was preventing
			custom theme CSS from loading.
		</fix>
		<fix author='adam' date='2008-07-14' ref='2014548' reftype='bug' reporter='thierry_leterre'>
			Roles: Additional fix for 'invalid default state' issues.
			
			The roles UI now rebuilds implicit AZs if an 'invalid default state'
			exception is raised, and then re-attempts to load the roles UI.
			
			Also added an admin-only action for manually rebuilding implicit AZs.
			
			It seems that some sites have been created with invalid or missing
			implicit AZs. Rebuilding the Hierarchy-caused Implicit AZs for the site 
			fixes this issue. This should not be necessary for newly created sites.
		</fix>
	</version>
	<version number="2.0-beta-26" date="2008-07-11">
		<releaseNotes>
			This release fixes a major bug in the permissions/role-setting system
			that was preventing modifications of roles for some groups. Also improved
			are the RSS feed-display plugin's support for slightly non-conforming
			feeds and a few other minor issues.
			
			As of this beta 25, Segue requires PHP to be compiled with XSL support.
			On unix systems this can be added by configuring PHP using the --with-xsl
			option. See the following for installation instructions:
			http://www.php.net/manual/en/xsl.installation.php
			
			Upgrades from versions prior to beta 26 require running the RSS Feed
			updaters located under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates.

		</releaseNotes>
		<fix author='adam' date='2008-07-11' ref='2014548' reftype='bug' reporter='laurel_taylor'>
			Roles: Fixed Roles issue with 'invalid default state'.

			It appears that since the transition to the new AuthZ2 implementation,
			the roles system has not been working correctly when setting complex
			authorization. This issue stems from the 'new' property of 
			view authorizations cascading up as well as down. This cascading up
			was confusing the roles system. When there was no site-wide view 
			authorization the roles system thought that there was due to a view 
			authorization cascading up from a story or page.
			
			This has now been sorted out and the roles system only looks at implicit
			authorizations that cascade down when determining what role to display
			for a user.
		</fix>
		<change author='adam' date='2008-07-11'>
			Plugins: RSS remote access script now validates and cleans RSS doc instead of 
			using XSD validation.

			The schema was too strict and failing on too many feeds. Since the
			reader only uses a few elements in the feed, these are verified and
			cleaned.
		</change>
		<fix author='adam' date='2008-07-11'>
			Plugins: Extended cached size of RSS data.
		</fix>
		<fix author='adam' date='2008-07-11'>
			Plugins: Cached RSS data is now deleted after expiration time on any
			cache addition, not just its own.

			UI2: New menu items are selected after creation.
		</change>
	</version>
	<version number="2.0-beta-25" date="2008-07-10">
		<releaseNotes>
			This release adds the capability to display RSS feeds inline in a site
			and fixes a wide range of bugs.
			
			Notable User-facing changes:
			- Can now display RSS feeds in a site.
			- 'New Mode' is now the default user interface.
			- Migration fixes enable more sites to be successfully migrated.
			- Major speed improvements for users viewing sites without editing access.
			
			Upgrades from versions prior to beta 25 require running the RSS Feed
			updater	located under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates.

			View/Portal: Major speed improvements for non-editor and non-logged in users.
			Now only checking 'add_children' authorization for determining when to 
			show mode-switching links, saving dramatically on the number of authorization
			queries when all such queries return false. As well, mode-switching-link checks will
			simply be bypassed if the user is not authenticated to prevent even more
			authorization queries.
		</change>
		<fix author='adam' date='2008-07-09' ref='2014319' reftype='bug' reporter='jeff_merriman'>
			Starting Site: Now doesn't require a second click to access other parts
			of the site when using a custom starting site.
		</fix>
		<fix author='adam' date='2008-07-09' ref='2013156' reftype='bug' reporter='gabe'>
			Authentication: Failed login followed by successful login now doesn't 
			retain the 'login failed' message.
		</fix>
		<change author='adam' date='2008-07-10'>
			Roles: With 'Editor' role set for 'everyone' log-in is required to edit.

			To accomplish this, the role-system now merges authorizations for the
			'edu.middlebury.agents.everyone' group and the 
			'edu.middlebury.agents.users' group when viewing or setting roles for 
			'Everyone'.
			
			The 'edu.middlebury.agents.everyone' group (which includes the anonymous
			user) is only ever given the 'reader' role (view authorization) and the
			view_comments authorization (part of the 'commenter' role) while the
			'edu.middlebury.agents.users' group	(which includes all authenticated 
			users, even visitors) is given the additional authorizations.
			
			As far as the UI is concerned site admins are just setting roles for
			'Everyone', but now anonymous users aren't being given grants to make
			changes. This should prevent spam and make modifications at least
			nominally traceable.
		</change>
		<fix author='adam' date='2008-07-09' ref='2009077' reftype='bug'>
			View: Fixed issue where theme name was printed in the site title. This
			was initially added in commit b633fb846d9addf2f8f7ef44a1f13e5db00c21d7
			as a debugging aid. The site title now includes the full breadcrumb trail.

		<releaseNotes>
			This release fixes a number of minor bugs that were affecting some
			users and adds support for setting a particular Segue site as the default

			As of this release Segue requires that PHP be compiled with the

			Segue versions beta-20 through beta-22 included a bug in which cascading

	<about>
		Segue is an open source collaborative content management system designed 
		for e-learning that combines the ease of use of course management systems 
		with the flexibility of weblogs for creating various types of sites 
		including course, news, and journal.
		
		This Segue 2.0 beta is capable of most of the site creation and editing needs of  
		users. We are continually adding features to bring Segue 2 up to feature parity with  
		Segue 1.x. See the Feature Request Tracker for a list of features that still need to  
		be completed: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=82171&amp;atid=565237
