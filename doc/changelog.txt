	* Change: #2031895 
		View/UI1/UI2/Portal: Links to edit-mode are now shown to all users as these

		entire site, drastically improving page-load times such as from 35s to 1.3s
		on one particular site.
		
		Similarly, the 'permissions' button is now only displayed on pages where
		the user has authorization to work with permissions. This forces users who

		uploads in wizards on servers with safe-mode on.

v. 2.0-beta-27 (2008-07-17)
----------------------------------------------------
This release adds support for embedded Flash videos, text-templates, and fixes
several bugs.

Text-templates are a new extension system that use the same markup as MediaWiki's
templates to enable output of custom HTML blocks customized with a set of named
parameters. 

For example, a new 'video' template inserts embed code for videos from a variety of
providers defined in a white-list (to prevent XSS attacks). Example of usage:
{{video|service=youtube|id=s13dLaTIHSg|width=425|height=344}} This video template
will also search through the HTML source in a text-block and replace any embed
orobject elements with appropriate template markup.

Upgrades:

As of this beta 25, Segue requires PHP to be
compiled with XSL support. On unix systems this can be added by configuring PHP
using the --with-xsl option. See the following for installation instructions: http://www.php.net/manual/en/xsl.installation.php

Upgrades from versions prior to beta 26 require running the RSS Feed updaters
located under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates.
		
		
	* New feature: 
		Text-Templates: New 'text-templates' extension system uses markup like
		MediaWiki's templates to enable output of HTML blocks given a template and
		set of parameters. A 'video' template to enabled white-listed embedded video
		and a 'search' template to insert a search form are the first uses of this
		new system.
		(2008-07-16 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: #2013487 
		Text-Templates: New 'video' template inserts embed code for videos from a
		variety of providers defined in a white-list to prevent XSS attacks. This
		template will also search an HTML block and replace any embed or object
		elements with appropriate template markup. Example:
		{{video|service=youtube|id=s13dLaTIHSg|width=425|height=344}} 
		(2008-07-16 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Text-Templates: New 'search' template inserts a search form for a variety of
		providers or custom search end-points. Insert {{search}} into a text-content
		block to use.
		(2008-07-16 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		UI2: Accessing edit-mode when not logged in now doesn't cause a fatal error
		of a class not found.
		(2008-07-15 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2018685 
		UI2: Quotes in titles no longer break XHTML validity.
		(2008-07-16 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2018232 
		Themes: Themes with non-default options set now load CSS files with the
		option choices. Fixes for this are in Harmoni (commit
		de26816ffa93753366584861cb798380eb8ef09a) and Polyphony (commit
		717117f3e9f05e63e9a1e4f79fc9efed34f2ebb9). 
		(2008-07-17 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2018218 
		RSS: Feeds in alternate encodings are now converted to UTF-8.
		(2008-07-17 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: #2018160 
		Migration: All characters in Segue v1 tags other than alphanumeric and
		underscores are converted to underscore in order to comply with Segue v2 tag
		validation. 
		(2008-07-17 - Alex Chapin)
	



v. 2.0-beta-26.1 (2008-07-14)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a few bugs that were not fixed in beta 26.

---------------------

From Beta 26:

As of this beta 25, Segue requires PHP to be compiled with XSL support. On unix
systems this can be added by configuring PHP using the --with-xsl option. See the
following for installation instructions: http://www.php.net/manual/en/xsl.installation.php

Upgrades from versions prior to beta 26 require running the RSS Feed updaters
located under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates.

-----------------------

Segue 2.0-beta-26.1 uses Harmoni 1.4.2 and Polyphony
1.2.8. 
		
		
	* Bug Fix: #2017290 
		Themes: Added missing method getModificationDate() that was preventing
		custom theme CSS from loading.
		(2008-07-14 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Laurel Taylor of Middlebury College)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2014548 
		Roles: Additional fix for 'invalid default state' issues.
		
		The roles UI now rebuilds implicit AZs if an 'invalid default state'
		exception is raised, and then re-attempts to load the roles UI.
		
		Also added an admin-only action for manually rebuilding implicit AZs.
		
		It seems that some sites have been created with invalid or missing
		implicit AZs. Rebuilding the Hierarchy-caused Implicit AZs for the site
		fixes this issue. This should not be necessary for newly created sites.
		(2008-07-14 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Thierry Leterre of Middlebury College/Université de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines)
	



v. 2.0-beta-26 (2008-07-11)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a major bug in the permissions/role-setting system that was
preventing modifications of roles for some groups. Also improved are the RSS
feed-display plugin's support for slightly non-conforming feeds and a few other
minor issues.

As of this beta 25, Segue requires PHP to be compiled with XSL support. On unix
systems this can be added by configuring PHP using the --with-xsl option. See the
following for installation instructions: http://www.php.net/manual/en/xsl.installation.php

Upgrades from versions prior to beta 26 require running the RSS Feed updaters
located under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates.

Segue 2.0-beta-25 uses Harmoni 1.4.2 and Polyphony 1.2.7.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: #2014548 
		Roles: Fixed Roles issue with 'invalid default state'.
		
		It appears that since the transition to the new AuthZ2 implementation,
		the roles system has not been working correctly when setting complex
		authorization. This issue stems from the 'new' property of view
		authorizations cascading up as well as down. This cascading up was confusing
		the roles system. When there was no site-wide view authorization the roles
		system thought that there was due to a view authorization cascading up from
		a story or page.
		
		This has now been sorted out and the roles system only looks at implicit
		authorizations that cascade down when determining what role to display for a
		user. 
		(2008-07-11 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Laurel Taylor of Middlebury College)
		
	* Change: 
		Plugins: RSS remote access script now validates and cleans RSS doc instead
		of using XSD validation.
		
		The schema was too strict and failing on too many feeds. Since the reader
		only uses a few elements in the feed, these are verified and cleaned.
		(2008-07-11 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Plugins: Extended cached size of RSS data.
		(2008-07-11 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Plugins: Cached RSS data is now deleted after expiration time on any cache
		addition, not just its own.
		(2008-07-11 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: #2009044 
		UI2: New menu items are selected after creation.
		(2008-07-11 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 2.0-beta-25 (2008-07-10)
----------------------------------------------------
This release adds the capability to display RSS feeds inline in a site and fixes a
wide range of bugs.

Notable User-facing changes:

 * Can now display RSS feeds in a site.

 * 'New Mode' is now the default user interface.

 * Migration fixes enable more sites to be successfully migrated.

 * Major speed improvements for users viewing sites without editing access.

Upgrades from versions prior to beta 25 require running the RSS Feed updaterlocated
under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates.

Segue 2.0-beta-25 uses Harmoni 1.4.1 and Polyphony 1.2.7.
		
		
	* Change: #1998213 
		Dataport: Added status display during site import.
		(2008-07-10 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Dataport: Added more error checking during import process to help debug
		import problems.
		(2008-07-10 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: #2009035 
		UI: New Mode now the default editing UI.
		(2008-07-10 - Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature: #1820785 
		Plugins: New RSS feed-display plugin to allow in-line display of RSS feeds.
		(2008-06-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		As of this release, Segue requires PHP to be compiled with XSL support. See
		the following for installation:
		http://www.php.net/manual/en/xsl.installation.php 
		(2008-07-07 - Adam Franco)
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		Run the RSS display updater under Admin Tools -> Segue Updates to enable the
		RssFeed plugin.
		(2008-07-08 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: #1959168 
		View/Portal: Major speed improvements for non-editor and non-logged in
		users. Now only checking 'add_children' authorization for determining when
		to show mode-switching links, saving dramatically on the number of
		authorization queries when all such queries return false. As well,
		mode-switching-link checks will simply be bypassed if the user is not
		authenticated to prevent even more authorization queries.
		(2008-07-10 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Jeff Merriman of MIT)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2014319 
		Starting Site: Now doesn't require a second click to access other parts of
		the site when using a custom starting site.
		(2008-07-09 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Jeff Merriman of MIT)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2013156 
		Authentication: Failed login followed by successful login now doesn't retain
		the 'login failed' message.
		(2008-07-09 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Roles: With 'Editor' role set for 'everyone' log-in is required to edit.
		
		To accomplish this, the role-system now merges authorizations for the
		'edu.middlebury.agents.everyone' group and the 'edu.middlebury.agents.users'
		group when viewing or setting roles for 'Everyone'.
		
		The 'edu.middlebury.agents.everyone' group (which includes the anonymous
		user) is only ever given the 'reader' role (view authorization) and the
		view_comments authorization (part of the 'commenter' role) while the
		'edu.middlebury.agents.users' group(which includes all authenticated users,
		even visitors) is given the additional authorizations.
		
		As far as the UI is concerned site admins are just setting roles for
		'Everyone', but now anonymous users aren't being given grants to make
		changes. This should prevent spam and make modifications at least nominally
		traceable. 
		(2008-07-10 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2009077 
		View: Fixed issue where theme name was printed in the site title. This was
		initially added in commit b633fb846d9addf2f8f7ef44a1f13e5db00c21d7 as a
		debugging aid. The site title now includes the full breadcrumb trail.
		(2008-07-09 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2009092 
		Migration: Segue v1 sites with null creation dates no longer halts site
		migration. 
		(2008-07-08 - Alex Chapin)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2009095 
		Migration: Segue v1 null agent information now replaced with unknown agent
		and no longer halts site migration
		(2008-07-08 - Alex Chapin)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2009104 
		Migration: migrating theme options from Segue v1 that do not exist in Segue
		v2 no longer throws an error
		(2008-07-07 - Alex Chapin)
		
	* Change: 
		Plugins: Manager now executes any script blocks when reloading the plugin
		after AJAX update.
		(2008-06-17 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: #1820785 
		Plugins: Plugins can now get URLs for static files in their own 'public'
		directories. Enables serving of custom javascript/images/css.
		(2008-06-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: #1820785 
		Plugins: Plugins can now specify CSS and Javascript files to be linked from
		the document head.
		(2008-06-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Themes: Theme CSS now configured to be loaded from a separate file to cut
		down on document size.
		(2008-06-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Updates: Updates now check for authorization.
		(2008-07-10 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 2.0-beta-24 (2008-06-16)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a number of minor bugs that were affecting some users and adds
support for setting a particular Segue site as the default page when no particular
action or site is specified.

As of this release Segue requires that PHP be compiled with the

 *-enable-mbstring option. This option adds enhanced support for translation of
strings between character sets and is needed for exporting sites.

Segue 2.0-beta-23 uses Harmoni 1.4.0 and Polyphony 1.2.6.

This release of Segue 2.0 includes dramatic speed improvements over beta 19.1 due to
a new implementation of Harmoni's Authorization and Hierarchy system. Usage of this
new systems requires running the appropriate updater located under Admin Tools -->
Segue Updates. This updater will take several minutes to run and will make
irrevocable changes to your database. Please back up your database before running
this updater.

Other improvements to Segue include support for migrating tags from Segue 1 sites,
and an improved installation process.

Segue 2.0 beta 20 uses Polyphony 1.1.0 and Harmoni 1.2.0.
		
		
	* New feature: #1951075 
		AuthZ2: New Authorization/Hierarchy package stores implicit authorizations
		as rows in their own table so that they can be quickly read at the expense
		of a small increase in writing time and storage space.
		
		Usage of this new systems requires running the appropriate updater
		located under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates. This updater will take several
		minutes to run and will make irrevocable changes to your database. Please
		back up your database before running this updater.
		
		Please note that in AuthZ2 the 'edu.middlebury.authorization.view'
		function has the property of cascading up the hierarchy as well as down.
		This property is needed by our Segue and Concerto applications and the lack
		of it in the original implementations required the use of the
		isAuthorizedBelow() function. All other authorization functions cascade down
		only. 
		(2008-04-24 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: #1940489 
		Migration: have added support for migrating tags in Segue v2 sites and from
		Segue 1x sites

		Migration: SiteExport schema now allows for tags in export.
		(2008-04-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change:

		causing table-locking conflicts when a second (Harmoni_Db) database
		connection was used in tandem with the DatabaseManager connection.
		(2008-05-01 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Installer: Installation is now a 2-stage process. This allows new
		installations to have their database tables created in one execution cycle
		and then have their services configured in the second cycle.
		(2008-05-01 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Configuration: Added ClassesDN option to default Authentication config. Also
		removed unneeded variables before arguments.
		(2008-05-01 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Portal: Speed increases for 'All Visible' and 'All Editable' folders.
		
		'All Visible' now doesn't need to check the entire site as view AZs
		cascade up. 'All Editable' now first checks view AZ before doing the more
		expensive check of the entire site for edit AZ.

(such as from LDAP) underneath locally defined groups.

Segue 2.0.0-beta-3 runs on Harmoni 0.13.3 and Polyphony 0.10.3.

Changes to the Agent tables require running a database updater script:
