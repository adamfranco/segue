v. 2.0-beta-21.2 (2008-05-22)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a few small issues found in 2.0 beta 21.1.

In addition to portal speed improvements, thumbnail images now work again.

Upgrades from versions prior to beta 21 require running the appropriate
updaterlocated under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		Themes: Fixed text-color on Rounded Corner theme to be more visible.
		(2008-05-21 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #1968671 
		Portal: Speed improvements
		
		Folders can now report a pre-sorted flag to indicate to the list that
		authorization doesn't need to be checked when paginating.
		
		Folders can also now indicate a desire not to show edit controls. This
		prevents authorization traversal of huge numbers of sites when viewing the
		"All Visible" Folder.

v. 2.0-beta-21.1 (2008-05-20)

This release of Segue adds theming choices for sites. Site-editors can now choose
between a number of built-in themes, each of which supports a number of options for
changing color scheme and/or fonts.

Additionally, local copies of any theme can be created for a site. These copies
enable site-editors to modify the CSS and HTML templates that define a theme,
enabling full customization for users familiar with CSS and HTML. In a future
release we will eventually add a public gallery of themes that users will be able to
submit their themes to and choose themes for their sites from.

New themes in this release: Rounded Corners, Shadow Box, Tabs.

		as rows in their own table so that they can be quickly read at the expense
		of a small increase in writing time and storage space.
		
		Usage of this new systems requires running the appropriate updater
		located under Admin Tools --> Segue Updates. This updater will take several
		minutes to run and will make irrevocable changes to your database. Please
		back up your database before running this updater.
		
		Please note that in AuthZ2 the 'edu.middlebury.authorization.view'
		function has the property of cascading up the hierarchy as well as down.
		This property is needed by our Segue and Concerto applications and the lack
		of it in the original implementations required the use of the
		isAuthorizedBelow() function. All other authorization functions cascade down
		only.

		Configuration: Added ClassesDN option to default Authentication config. Also
