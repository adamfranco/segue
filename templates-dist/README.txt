About Templates
------------------------

Segue templates are 'starting points for sites'. Templates are simply exported
sites with an additional info.xml file and a thumbnail.png file.

Segue has two template directories:
	segue/templates-dist/
	segue/templates-local/

Templates that ship with Segue live in templates-dist/ and templates created by you should
live in the templates-local/ directory. If you create a template in the templates-local/ directory
of the same name as one in the templates-dist/ directory, the templates-local/ version
will be used instead.
